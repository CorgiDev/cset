    <h1>Advisory</h1>
    <p>CSET® is only one component of the overall cybersecurity picture and should be complemented with a robust cyber
      security program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of security weaknesses, 
      and should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture. The tool will not provide a detailed 
      architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network hardware/software configuration review. It is not a risk 
      analysis tool so it will not generate a complex risk assessment. CSET® is not intended as a substitute for in depth analysis 
      of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must 
      still be conducted using a holistic approach including facility walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination 
      of facility practices. Consideration should also be given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and 
      exercises on surrogate, training, or non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other 
      unexpected results will not compromise production or safety. CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any 
      one individual. A cross-functional team consisting of representatives from operational, maintenance, information technology, 
      business, and security areas is essential. The representatives must be subject matter experts with significant expertise 
      in their respective areas. No one individual has the span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions. 
      Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a manner appropriate 
      to their sensitivity.

    <h1>Security Assurance Level (SAL)</h1>
      <p>Care should be taken when comparing sites with different overall Security Assurance Levels (SAL).  
        As sites with a high SAL may have a lower overall security score from a percentage perspective but 
        may be more secure overall because they are working to a higher level.  When comparing different 
        sites it may be worthwhile to compare the total number of questions and total number of yes/no answers 
        in addition to the overall percentage scores.
